# How can technology help foster a safe and reliable _data sharing economy_ for smart manufacturing enterprise?


## Motivation
- Small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) often lack skills and resources required to perform in-house PHM analytics.
- Cloud computing services provide SMEs the option to outsource the analytics on cloud, but the data owners' unwillingness to share data from privacy concerns is a critical bottleneck.

## Contribution
- In this study, we showcased how homomorphic encryption can enable a secure PHM outsourcing with high precision for SMEs.
- We introduced a frequency-based peak detection algorithm (_H-FFT-C_) that generates a machine health diagnosis and prescription report, while keeping the machine data private.
