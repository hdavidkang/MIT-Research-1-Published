# How can technology help foster a safe and reliable _data sharing economy_ for smart manufacturing enterprise?


## ðŸš€ Motivation
Small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) often lack skills and resources required to perform in-house PHM analytics. While cloud-based services provide SMEs the option to outsource PHM analytics in the cloud, a critical limiting factor to such arrangement is the data ownerâ€™s unwillingness to share data due to data privacy concerns.

## ðŸŽ“ Contribution
In this study, we showcased how homomorphic encryption can enable a secure PHM outsourcing with high precision for SMEs. We introduced a frequency-based peak detection algorithm (_H-FFT-C_) that generates a machine health diagnosis and prescription report, while keeping the machine data private.
